This page lists all common issues regarding the Hack Pack and/or NetPlay sessions. No support is provided for this as it *works on my machine.* ðŸ™‚

    :ref:`The Hack Pack is no longer developed. What you see is what you get.`

Hack Pack Troubleshooting
-------------------------

- **Missing or Blank Textures**

Verify that you are using the latest Beta instead of a random build.

Change your graphical settings to a different backend such as Vulkan or OpenGL.

Ensure LAN adapter is not enabled if you are attempting to access the Debug menu.


- **Controller not Working**

Ensure you have setup your controller on the newly downloaded build.

If issue still occurring, your problem exists with controller or other software not related to netplay build.


- **Changing Music crashes Console**

This feature is only available to the Dolphin Emulator version of the game.


NetPlay Troubleshooting
-----------------------

- **Desync Issues**

Desyncs are normal as caused by Fullscreen codes

.. note::
    :ref:`This desync should notify during the start of City Trial, or a higher frame than 1000.`

If players are moving erratically, an actual desync has occurred.

Ensure MD5 hash and Gecko Codes are the same (except Fullscreen), and that you are not syncing memory cards or codes in the NetPlay settings.


- **Blank Screen or Seeing Wrong Camera**

Fullscreen codes are likely wrong. Ensure your Fullscreen code corresponds to the proper port. If you are intending to split-screen play, disable all Fullscreen codes.


- **Gameplay Lag**

Ensure a wired connection is being used. Furthermore, raise the buffer until a stable 60FPS gameplay is achieved.


- **Game Missing**

Use MD5 matching to ensure a non-corrupt and correct version of the game is being used.
